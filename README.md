# 42_get_next_line

Second project of the 42 cursus' common core.

It reproduces the behaviour of the getline() C function, that is used to read a string or a line from an input stream.

You can find comments pertaining to logic underlying my implementation directly in the code (filename get_next_line.c).

Algorithmically more challenging, I got to learn a lot about UNIX logic, syscalls, filesystems and input/output streams.
